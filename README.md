# Software Engineering | Tool for processing JSONs
This product is created for the programmers by the programmers. \
It's main purpose is to allow users reformat or filter structures saved in JSON format and to allow comparision between the JSONs. This tool will feature functionalities such as:
1. minimizing a JSON
2. reverting a JSON to it's orginal structure
3. searching for given keys
4. deleting given keys
5. comparing 2 JSONs and highlighting the difference between them \

Perhaps in the future will be accessible through custom made GUI to ease the usage.
